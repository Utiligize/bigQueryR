## Introduction 

![](bigqueryR.png)

This is a package for use with [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) from within R.

You may want to use [bigrquery](https://github.com/hadley/bigrquery) instead which is more developed with integration with `dplyr` etc. Some functions from `bigrquery` are used within this package.

### Why this package then?

This package is here as it uses [googleAuthR](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAuthR) as backend, so has Shiny support, and compatibility with other googleAuthR dependent packages.

It also has support for data extracts to Google Cloud Storage, meaning you can download data and make the download URL available to a user via their Google email. If you do a query normally with over 100000 results it hangs and errors. 

An example of a BigQuery Shiny app running OAuth2 is here, the [BigQuery Visualiser](https://mark.shinyapps.io/bigquery-viz/)

## Installation

Stable version ![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/bigQueryR) is now on CRAN

```

Development version off github: [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarkEdmondson1234/bigQueryR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarkEdmondson1234/bigQueryR)

```r
devtools::install_github("cloudyr/bigQueryR")
```

See the NEWS to see whats in each version. 

## Authentication

Authentication is as used in other `googleAuthR` libraries:

```r
library(bigQueryR)

## this will open your browser
## Authenticate with an email that has access to the BigQuery project you need
bqr_auth()

## verify under a new user
bqr_auth(new_user=TRUE)
```

If you are authenticating under several APIs via `googleAuthR`then use `gar_auth()` instead with the appropriate scopes set.

You can also use service-to-service JSON files and multi-user authentication under Shiny, see the `googleAuthR` readme for details.
